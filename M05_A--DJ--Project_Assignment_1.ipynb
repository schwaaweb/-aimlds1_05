    "The focus of the analysis will be oriented towards the following attributes within the cities of :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Violation Year\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Violation Month\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Violation Day of Week\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Age at Violation\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few objectives you need to accomplish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Examine the above-mentioned attributes in the data set for any missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If there are any missing values, treat the misisng values. Here is a article that provides insight into the common methods to deal with missing values:\n",

    "a) Mean, b) Median, c) Standard Deviation, d) Variance\n",

    "4) Construct a Boxplot to surface the 25%, 50% and 75% percentiles of \"Age at Violation\" by Gender\n",

    "b) Count of Violations by Month\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Count of Violations by Gender\n",

    "6) Hone in on the data set for the Year 2015. Does the 'Violation at Age' and the 'Total # Of Violations' vary together? Construct a scatter plot that plots the 'Violation at Age' v/s the Total # Of Violation'. Does the Scatter Plot point to a positive covariance? Now, compute the Covariance. Perform this analysis for both the genders.\n",

    "7) Compute the Correlation Coefficient between the 2 variable i.e. 'Violation at Age' and the 'Total # Of Violations'. Perform this analysis for both the genders."
