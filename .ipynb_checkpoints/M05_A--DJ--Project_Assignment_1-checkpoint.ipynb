    "3) Violation Day of Week\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Age at Violation\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Gender\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few objectives you need to accomplish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Examine the above-mentioned attributes in the data set for any missing values\n",

Construct a scatter plot that plots the 'Violation at Age' v/s the Total # Of Violation'. Does the Scatter Plot point to a positive covariance? Now, compute the Covariance. Perform this analysis for both the genders.\n",
